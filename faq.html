    <h3>What is the Metro Weather – Automated Weather Station (AWS) Project?</h3>
    <p>Metro Weather is a public-private partnership that has established a network of 30 automated weather stations (AWS) in Metro Manila. This network will provide free and near real-time weather data that can be used to prepare for severe weather conditions such as tropical cyclones and heavy flooding. The weather stations are spread over an approximate area of 625 square kilometers, and are distributed so that each station covers roughly 25 square kilometers.</p>

    <h3>Who are the Project Partners/Proponents?</h3>
    <p>The project partners are the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Chevron, the Manila Observatory (MO), Globe Telecom, and the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU).</p>

    <h3>What are the roles of the Project Partners/Proponents?</h3>
    <p>Chevron, through its business units (Chevron Philippines, Inc., Philippine Geothermal Production Company, Chevron Holdings, Inc. Chevron Malampaya LLC) have partnered to provide both the financial resources as well as technical and infrastructure support through select Caltex service stations in strategic locations. These stations shall host the AWS to provide Metro Manila residents with real-time weather monitoring as part of its commitment to safety and climate change adaptation.</p>
    <p>Manila Observatory conceptualized the establishment of a dense, urban network of AWS. MO provides the scientific and technical support in the installation, operation and maintenance of the AWS network. It participates in the public communication of the weather data. More importantly, MO analyzes the data in relation to potential disaster risk and provides research opportunities in urban disaster risk reduction and climate change.</p>
    <p>Globe Telecom, through its corporate social responsibility arm, Globe Bridging Communities, seeks partnerships that support its advocacy of environmental sustainability. By providing ICT infrastructure, Globe hopes to promote awareness of environmental issues to its employees and stakeholders, and prompt them to participate in activities that help conserve the environment and mitigate climate change.</p>
    <p>MMDA assisted in the selection of appropriate locations for the AWS, will support MO in providing information which will aid the development and implementation of an evidenced-based decision support system for urban risk reduction, and assist in the physical maintenance of the AWS.</p>
    <p>Ateneo, through the development of opportunities for student research in atmospheric physics, instrumentation development, and disaster risk reduction, assists in creating relevant academic and  research entry points for the analysis and communication of the AWS data.</p>

    <h3>Which areas will be covered by the Metro Weather Project?</h3>
    <p>The 30 AWS are deployed in major Metro Manila cities, and strategic areas like Antipolo City, Rodriguez, Angono and Jala-jala in Rizal.</p>
    <p>The AWS are placed in sites hosted by the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Chevron through its various Caltex retail stations around Metro Manila, and at Globe Telecom facilities. They are located in critical areas identified by the MMDA, from the upper Marikina watershed to the flood-prone sections of Metro Manila.</p>

    <h3>What is the Implementation Plan?</h3>
	<p>Data transmission from thirty stations will be powered by Globe, and sent to the MMDA through the Manila Observatory and the Ateneo de Manila University. These can be accessed freely via www.metroweather.com.ph, weatherlink.com and MMDA's app, “Metro Manila Traffic Navigator.”</p>
	
    <h3>Is there a cost to access the information?</h3>
	<p>There will be no cost to access the information through the websites and the MMDA app, “Metro Manila Traffic Navigator.”</p>

    <h3>What kind of information will I get from Metro Weather?</h3>
	<p>The Metro Weather stations will collect and store information such as rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, solar radiation and ultraviolet index.</p>
	
    <h3>How useful will this information be?</h3>
	<p>The near real-time weather data can be used to prepare for severe weather conditions such as tropical cyclones and heavy flooding. The data collected at these sites will also provide critical information for ongoing research on urban climate change and variability.</p>

    <h3>From the project partners:</h3>
    <p>"Mitigating climate change and its effects requires a concerted effort from the private and public sectors," said Chevron Country Chairman Jim Meynink. "This project represents what both can accomplish, which will ultimately help Metro Manila residents survive disasters caused by severe weather."</p>
    <p>"This system will provide information on significant weather events as a supplement to weather observations of Metro Manila. It is hoped that this privately initiated joint effort will also support education and research on urban disaster risk reduction in light of our changing climate," said MO Executive Director Antonia Yulo Loyzaga.</p>
    <p>"Metro Weather will also help save more lives on the road," said MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino, adding that Metro Weather's app, “Metro Manila Traffic Navigator,” will help motorists determine alternative routes during times of torrential rain and flooding.</p>
